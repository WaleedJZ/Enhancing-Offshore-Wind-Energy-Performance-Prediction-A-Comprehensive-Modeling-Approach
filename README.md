# Wind Energy Forecasting Using LSTM Models

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to predict offshore wind energy performance. The model leverages historical wind speed data to forecast wind energy output accurately, contributing to efficient grid management and supporting the integration of renewable energy sources into the national grid.

### Objectives
- To enhance the predictive accuracy of wind energy output from offshore turbines.
- To understand the impact of atmospheric conditions and wind speed at varying altitudes on energy production.
- To facilitate the integration and operational optimization of wind farms.
